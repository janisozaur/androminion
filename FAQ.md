## How can I choose which cards / expansions to play a game with? ##

Use a Dominion randomizer with Androminion integration (like Dominion Shuffle: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.spellenclubeindhoven.dominionshuffle) to select a kingdom setup, then launch Androminion from that app to play with the selected cards.

## Why does Secret Chamber loop infinitely? ##

You are permitted to reveal a reaction card like Moat or Secret Chamber multiple times per attack.  Usually it does not benefit you to do so, but occasionally it can, so such an ability is allowed.  Note that Secret Chamber never blocks an attack -- revealing it only allows the draw / replace ability.  Once you select "None" to move on, the attack will take effect.

## I played a Goons with a King's Court.  Why don't I get 3 VP per buy? ##

Actions "in play" is different from actions "played". See the entry for Goons in the Prosperity rulebook -- you only get 1 VP per buy per actual Goons card played, regardless of KC / TR.  (Cf. Princess, Haggler, Highway)

## I found another bug! ##

Check the open issues at http://code.google.com/p/androminion/issues/list -- if it hasn't yet been reported, fill out a new request.

## Can I help? ##

Absolutely!  We could definitely use help fixing the outstanding issues, especially with updating the UI to work on tablets.  Just leave us a message.
